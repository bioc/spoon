## Address the Mean-variance Relationship in Spatial Transcriptomics Data

This package contains functions to address the mean-variance relationship in
spatially resolved transcriptomics data. We are in the process of developing
this into a BioConductor package, at this time the functions can be accessed in 
the R subfolder.
